<h1>ACTIVITIES OF MY PETS</h1>
 <ul>
     <li><h3>GO FOR A WALK OR HIKE</h3></li><h3>Walks are by far one of the best activities for a dog and their human. Walks let them get out of their usual surroundings and explore. It also gives you both a chance to practice the behavioral commands you (might) have been working on. 

        You don’t need to take the same route for every walk. Let your dog sniff around and find things to investigate. This doesn’t mean you should let them wander at full leash length all the time, but you should allow them to look around to fulfill their natural curiosity.
        
        Geocaching. Geocaching is an activity where someone hides something and uses their GPS to mark its location. Have someone place treats or toys at a site and take your dog out for a hunt. When you get close, have them try to locate the toy, and celebrate with them when they do.</h3>
    <li><h3>SWIMMING</h3></li><h3> Many dogs love the water. Find somewhere to take your dog for a swim. Dogs can play fetch in the water, and most love to swim with their humans too. Get in the water with them and enjoy the swim.</h3>
    <li><h3>PLAYDATE</h3></li><h3>Much like humans, dogs are social animals who need time with others. If you have neighbors or friends that have dogs, see if they would meet up and let their dog(s) play with yours. There should be a period of letting the dogs get to know each other before letting them off the leash to play. Once they are familiar, let them run and have fun.</h3>
    <li><h3>FETCH</h3></li><h3>The all-time favorite game for dogs and their humans. You don’t need much for this game. Your tools might depend on the type of dog. A Czechoslovakian shepherd can play fetch with a two-inch diameter tree branch, while a Chihuahua might need something a bit smaller. Of course, you can always have your dog</h3>
