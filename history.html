    <h1>History Of Dogs</h1>
    <p><h5>Dogs have been part of our history for thousands of years. No one knows for sure when the relationship started, but we do know that dogs were initially used to work alongside their humans. Dogs were bred for a multitude of purposes that ranged from fighting in wars to eliminating rodents.

        People chose dogs based on their intelligence, size, and breed for specific purposes. As humans evolved, their four-legged companions did too. They developed together to the modern age, where people now leave them alone for long periods of time. This means that dogs bred for activity have nothing to do.
